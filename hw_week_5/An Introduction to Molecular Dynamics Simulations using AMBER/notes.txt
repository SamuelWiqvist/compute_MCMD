To load AmberTools on LUNARC run:

ml load  icc/2017.4.196-GCC-6.4.0-2.28
ml load OpenMPI/2.1.1
ml load Ambertools/18.10

To use VMD we have to load the correct module with 

module load vmd/1.9.2

The run script for the MD sim that we run is in the file: job_amber_md.sh

Comments on tutorial:

Could not run saveamberparm foo parm7 rst7 - had to use the provided files instead 

The command tail -f 03_Prod.out will not work when we run the sim on lunarc 

the total MD sim took: ~ 8.5 min (should take 10 min according to tutorial)

I will create the plots with julia 

could not run $AMBERHOME/bin/cpptraj -p parm7 -i rmsd.cpptraj &> cpptraj.log got some strange errors... had to use the provided files
